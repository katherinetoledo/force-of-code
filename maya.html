      <h3> Name </h3>

      <h4><em> Maya </em></h4>

      <h3> Occupation </h3>

    <h4> <em> Personal Trainer (specialising in pre and post natal exercise) </em></h4>

      <h3> Why did you want to do a coding course? </h3>

    <h4> <em> I love how empowered women are becoming, especially young millienial women. I think that being as self sufficient as possible is a big key to progression across most aspects in life. Knowing how to code seems like a crucial tool with regards to how the world is spinning now! </em> </h4>

      <h3> Where do you want to be next year? </h3>

    <h4> <em> Next year I would like my podcast to be sponsored, my retreats to be consistently seasonal and sold out and to be more financially comfortable. </em>

    </h4>

      <h3> What is your favourtie food? </h3>

      <h4> <em> My favorite food is too much of a difficult question!! I fall in love with food all over again about 4 times a day!! At the moment.. I‚Äôm loving my good freinds home made date and nut energy balls üòç. </em>

      </h4>

      <h3> Whats your fave meme atm? </h3>

      <center>
        <img src="images/mayas meme.png" width="200px">
      </center>


<h3> What was your last search on the internet? </h3>


<h4>  <em> This is the <a class="podcast" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tried+it+podcast">link</a> I click on most to check if we have new subscribers!! And to watch the episode back! </em> </h4>

      <h3> Who inspires you? </h3>

<h4> <em>  As corny as it sounds..I am most inspired by the women in my every day life. For me, achievements and accolaides are not enough for me to find you inspirational. I need to know that you are also a nice person with genuine intentions. Thats why I am most inspired by all of the ladies that I run businesses with, such as Kedeisha and Jade (the other two members of Tried It Podcast) and Juspreet Kaur (the co- founder of boss your body events). I love being in a hub of collaboration and creativity, intertwined with friendship. All my mates inpire me, the end. </em> </h4>

  <h3> Worst part of the coding course?</h3>

<h4><em> When the course started I was in California, so my first class was actually, the groups second class. As luck would have it.. I was running late too, so arrived to class later than everyone in the curriculum and LATER than 6:30pm! I felt really overwhlemed by all the letters symbols and numbers on the screen in front of me! </em> </h4>

<h3> Best part of the coding course? </h3>
<h4> <em> We were put into our groups and given the task of creating a site. EVERYONE was a bit thrown and apprehensive, however 20 minutes in, it felt like our given groups were due to become our newest family members and it has felt the same ever since!</em> </h4>

      Why did you want to do a coding course?

      <em> <br>I love how empowered women are becoming, especially young millienial women. I think that being as self sufficient as possible is a big key to progression across most aspects in life. Knowing how to code seems like a crucial tool with regards to how the world is spinning now!

      Who inspires you?

<em> <br>  As corny as it sounds..I am most inspired by the women in my every day life. For me, achievements and accolaides are not enough for me to find you inspirational. I need to know that you are also a nice person with genuine intentions. Thats why I am most inspired by all of the ladies that i run businesses with, such as Kedeisha and Jade (the other two members of Tried It POdcast) and Juspreet Kaur (the co- founder of boss your body events). I love being in the middle of a hub of collaboration and creativity, intertwined with freindship. All my mates inpire me, the end. </br> </em>

<h2>
Worst part of the coding course?
<em> <br>
When the course started I was in California, so my first class was actually, the groups second class. As luck would have it.. I was running late too, so arrived a class behind and LATE! I felt really overwhlemed by all the letters symbols and numbers on the screen in front of me!</br> </em>

      </h2>

<h2>
Best part of the coding course?
<em> <br> We were put into our groups and given the task of creating a site. EVERYONE was a bit thrown and apprehensive, however 20 minutes in, it felt like our given groups were due to become our newest family members and it has felt the same ever since!</br> </em>
